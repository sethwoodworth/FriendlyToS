**Welcome to Pinterest!** Pinterest is an online and mobile service that allows you to create online pinboards and organize and share beautiful things you find on the web.  Pinterest lets you create your own visual collections or “boards,” and view and follow other boards, on pinterest.com (the "Site"), on our application for mobile devices (the “Mobile Software”), and through third party applications.  We call the services available on the Site, whether accessed directly, or through the Mobile Software or such third party applications, the “Service(s).”



The Pinterest Service is provided by Pinterest, Inc., however, we will refer to our company and Service as “Pinterest” to keep things simple.  Like all online services, we need to have a Terms of Service (“Terms”).  Please read these Terms carefully, and email us at [support@pinterest.com](mailto:support@pinterest.com) if you have any questions.  By accessing or using the Pinterest Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our [Privacy Policy](http://pinterest.com/about/privacy/), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.  These Terms apply to all visitors, registered users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).


###1. Sharing Your Content



  1. **Your content.**  Pinterest allows you to pin and post content on the Service, including photos, comments, and other materials.  Anything that you pin, post, display, or otherwise make available on our Service, including all Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) in such content, is referred to as “User Content.”  You retain all of your rights in all of the User Content you post to our Service.
  2. **How Pinterest and other users can use your content.**  Subject to any applicable account settings you select, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, re-pin, modify (e.g., re-format), re-arrange, and distribute your User Content on Pinterest for the purposes of operating and providing the Service(s) to you and to our other Users.  Nothing in these Terms shall restrict Pinterest’s rights under separate licenses to User Content.  Please remember that the Pinterest Service is a public platform, and that other Users may search for, see, use, and/or re-pin any User Content that you make publicly available through the Service.
  3. **How long we keep your content:**  Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User Content from your account or your boards, Pinterest may retain your User Content for a commercially reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.  Furthermore, Pinterest and other Users may retain and continue to display, reproduce, re-pin, modify, re-arrange, and distribute any of your User Content that other Users have re-pinned to their own boards or which you have posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service.
  4. **Your responsibility for your content:**
      1. **To Pinterest and our community.**  Pinterest provides a creative and positive place for you to discover and share things you love.

Please — be a good citizen on Pinterest, and always respect our Service and its Users.
      2. **To third parties.**  Pinterest values and respects the rights of third party creators and content owners, and expects you to do the same.  You therefore agree that any User Content that you post to the Service does not and will not violate any law or infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (defined below), publicity rights or rights of privacy.  We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove User Content from the Service for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or the Pinterest Acceptable Use Policy.  It is important that you understand that you are in the best position to know if the materials you post are legally allowed.  We therefore ask that you please be careful when deciding whether to make User Content available on our Service, including whether you can pin or re-pin User Content on your boards.

  6. **Feedback you provide:**  We value hearing from our Users, and are always interested in learning about ways we can make Pinterest more awesome.  You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments, ideas or feedback about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Feedback”).  By submitting any Feedback, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction; your disclosure will not place Pinterest under any fiduciary or other obligation; and we are free to use, disclose and otherwise exploit the Feedback without any restriction and without additional compensation to you.

###9. Disclaimers



THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL CONTENT AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER INCLUDED WITHIN THE SERVICES, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, PINTEREST SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.



PINTEREST takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service.  You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your AND OTHER USERS’ online distribution and publication of your AND THEIR User Content.  You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.


###10. Limitation of Liability



YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES, PINTEREST CONTENT, AND USER CONTENT REMAINS WITH YOU AND YOU USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK.  YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER PINTEREST NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, USER CONTENT, PINTEREST CONTENT, OR FROM ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES OR OTHER PERSONS WITH WHOM YOU COMMUNICATE OR INTERACT AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT PINTEREST HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.



IN NO EVENT WILL PINTEREST’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY, OR THAT OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, USER CONTENT OR PINTEREST CONTENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).  THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN PINTEREST AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States.  Pinterest makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations.  Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable national, state, local or other laws, statutes, directives, rules, regulations, and all interpretations or orders of any government, administrative or regulatory authority or court, including but not limited to those related to export and import of software, technical information or services.  You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.  Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.


###11. Arbitration and Governing Law:



  1. For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us at [support@pinterest.com](mailto:support@pinterest.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  In the unlikely event that Pinterest has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you and Pinterest agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PINTEREST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
  2. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Pinterest, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.  These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Santa Clara County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions for which either party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, as further described in the Arbitration provision above.



###12. General Terms



  1. **Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms.**  Pinterest may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, “push” mobile notification, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Pinterest in our sole discretion.  Pinterest reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](http://pinterest.com/about/privacy/).  Pinterest may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically.

All other use is prohibited.
  4. **Export Control.**  Any software or technology obtained from Pinterest through the Service, including the Mobile Software, originates in the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations.  Such software and technology may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States.  In addition, software and technology obtained from Pinterest may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries.  It is your responsibility to comply with all U.S. and foreign export and import laws and regulations.
  5. **Entire Agreement/Severability.**  These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Pinterest in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Pinterest concerning the Service.  If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
  6. **No Waiver.**  No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Pinterest’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
  7. **Contact.** Please contact us at [support@pinterest.com](mailto:support@pinterest.com) with any questions regarding these Terms.
