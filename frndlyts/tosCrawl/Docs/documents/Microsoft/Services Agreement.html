        <p class="para">Promotion Points may expire at any time, as set forth in the messages related to that promotion. We may cancel, suspend, or otherwise limit your access to your Points balance if we suspect fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity on your Points balance. Once we delete Points from a balance, we will not reinstate them, except at our discretion. When we cancel, suspend, or otherwise limit access to your Points balance, your right to use your Points balance immediately ceases. We will use reasonable efforts to investigate Points balances that are subject to access limitations and to reach a final decision on the limitations promptly. In addition, we may limit your use of the Points service, including applying limits to: the number of Points you may have credited to your Points balance at one time; the number of Points you may redeem within a given time period (for example, one day); and the number of promotion Points you may obtain in a single event.</p>
        <p class="para">If we post Points to your balance for an activity that is subsequently voided, canceled or involves a returned item, then we will remove those Points from your balance. You must ensure that we properly post your Points to your Points balance. If you believe that you have validly acquired Points that we have not posted to your Points balance, we will not consider posting these Points unless you contact us within 12 months after the date you claimed to have acquired those Points. We may require reasonable documentation to support your claim.</p>
