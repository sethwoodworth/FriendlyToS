      ##         Gifts             



      Newegg.com                 offers complimentary customer appreciation gifts with the purchase of selected merchandise.

And, in case you forget to add a gift                 to your cart, an intermediary page will be promoted to provide you with a second                 chance. Gift offers valid only while supplies last.


      ##          Combo Specials     



      Combo Specials are offered by                 Newegg.com                 as a way of purchasing two items together at a discounted price. To take advantage                 of a listed Combo Special, select the desired Combo Special from the individual                 item listing and click Add to Cart. Both items will be added to your shopping cart,                 and the advertised discount will be applied on the Order Confirmation screen.

Only one of each Combo Special                 can be purchased per order. Offers valid only while supplies of both items last.                 If you attempt to purchase multiple units of a Combo Special, be advised that items                 with a mail-in rebate will yield only one redeemable rebate offer (per the manufacturer's                 "limit one per household" provision).                 Newegg.com                 cannot guarantee the compatibility of combo items. Please contact the manufacturer(s)                 directly if you have issues or concerns regarding compatibility.

            still incur a shipping charge.*


      ##         Bundle Specials

      ##          Promo Codes



      Newegg.com         will sometimes furnish an alphanumeric code that can be used for promotions on our         Web site. These promotional codes may be found in print and/or online advertisements,         sent via email to our Newsletter and/or Promotion subscribers, presented on the         Newegg.com         Web site or circulated at events and through other means. Some of the specials offered         by entering a Promo Code during checkout include free shipping, volume discounts, free gifts or complimentary Rush Order processing.         The provisions for a Promo Code will be included with the code itself; if an expiration         date or other condition is stipulated, just reference where you acquired the code         for the exact requirements. Please note that Promo Codes are not redeemable for         cash and you must spend more than the discount price in order for a promotion to         be applied. For example, if a Promo Code offered $10.00 off your next purchase,         you would need to spend more than $10.00 to redeem your discount.

      ##         Sales Tax



      Sales tax is only required for orders shipping into states where we have or may             have nexus for state tax purposes under applicable laws. Therefore all orders shipping             into             California, New Jersey and Tennessee             will be charged applicable sales tax according to your area's tax rate. Please note             that the sales tax for             New Jersey and Tennessee             orders is calculated based upon the total price of the order, including shipping             and handling. The tax imposed by these states on shipping and handling is part of             the state sales tax, not a separate tax.


      ##             Duty Tax



      FedEx only offers 2Day or overnight services to Hawaii and Alaska. If you have selected             FedEx Saver as your preferred shipping option and attempt to checkout, the shipping             method will default to 2Day and you will subsequently be charged accordingly.


      ##                 Electronic Waste Recycling Act



      The Electronic Waste Recycling Act ("Act") became law in California on                 January 1, 2005. The primary objective of this law is to initiate a recycling program                 for computer products containing chemicals deemed hazardous to the environment.                 To fund this program, California requires retailers and e-tailers to collect, on                 the state's behalf, a fee for each product covered by this law. The fee is paid                 by the consumer at the time of purchase of the covered product. This fee will be                 remitted directly to the state by and only applies to orders shipped within California.



      The types of products that we are required to collect this recycling fee include                 cathode ray tubes, cathode ray tube devices, flat panel screens, and other similar                 video display devices. The actual amount of the recycling fee will vary, based on                 the screen size of the product when measured diagonally, as follows:



      * Greater than 4" and less than 15" -- $6.00
      * Greater than or equal to 15" and less than 35" -- $8.00
      * Greater than or equal to 35" -- $10.00




      For more information concerning the scope and details of the Act, please refer to                 the California Integrated Waste Management Board's website at [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Electronics/Act2003](http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Electronics/Act2003) or to the Department
                of Toxic Substances Control's website at [http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/CRTs/SB20.html](http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/CRTs/SB20.html).


      ##             Cell Phone and Rechargeable Battery Recycling Program



      Newegg.com             has a system in place for the acceptance and collection of used cell phones and             used rechargeable batteries for reuse, recycling or proper disposal.

            use that system, at no cost to you.


      ##          Product Testing



      Newegg.com, like other e-tailers, ships items in the condition they were received from the         original manufacturer/distributor.         Newegg.com         does not conduct product testing before shipping any merchandise.



      Marketplace: Newegg Marketplace sellers may or may not conduct product testing.          Check the Seller's Policy Page for information on the product testing practices          of individual Marketplace sellers.


      ##         "Must Be Purchased with Hardware"



      The "must be purchased with hardware" precept is mandated by the software                 publisher. In accordance,                 Newegg.com                 customers must purchase some type of product which falls under the general category                 of computer hardware in order to purchase applicable software. Hardware is classified                 as any component that will be used when assembling a computer system (a hard drive,                 motherboard, processor and a floppy drive are all examples of merchandise that will                 qualify). There is no specific or set price the hardware has to be, merely that                 there is some sort of eligible hardware present in the order itself.


      ##         Money Back Guarantee/Refund Policy



      All merchandise *unless otherwise indicated* may be returned within 30 days
        from the original invoice date for a refund.
        
                CPUs must be returned within 7 days from the invoice date for a refund.
        A return authorization number is required for all returns. A 15% restocking fee
        may apply.
        
                Additional deductions may be made for CPU returns to reflect the current market
                value.
            
        These terms apply to all refunds. Most products are shipped with a refund/replacement
        guarantee period unless otherwise noted in the product listing. Customers must inform
        Newegg.com
        of any order discrepancy within 7 days from the invoice date so that we may investigate
        and resolve the situation accordingly.



      Newegg.com         SATISFACTION GUARANTEE -         Newegg.com         offers our customers a 30-day satisfaction replacement or refund guarantee on all         purchases, except:



      * 7-day replacement or refund guarantee on all CPUs, including Open Box processors.                     All other Open Box merchandise has a 15-day warranty period.
      * For CPUs, the base cost will reflect the current market value, and the 15% restocking                     fee will be applied after this adjustment.
      * Downloadable software may not be exchanged or returned for a refund after purchase.
      * DVDs are non-refundable but may be exchanged for a functional version of the same                     film by using the pre-paid shipping label packaged with your order.
      * Marketplace: If you purchase an item from a Newegg Marketplace seller and need to return it,           you must return that item to the Marketplace seller rather than to Newegg. In general, Newegg           Marketplace sellers will honor Newegg's Money Back Guarantee and Return Policy set forth above.           However, certain exceptions may apply.  Check the Seller's Policy Page for the return policies           of individual Marketplace sellers.  In the event of a conflict between Newegg's return policies           and those on a Seller's Policy Page, the Seller's Policy Page return polices shall apply to your           orders from that seller.

      Marketplace: Newegg Marketplace sellers may have software return policies that differ          from Newegg's software return policy set forth above. Check the Seller's Policy Page          for the software return policies of individual Marketplace sellers. In the event of a          conflict between Newegg's software return policy and those on a Seller's Policy Page,          the Seller's Policy Page software return polices shall apply to your software orders          from that seller.


      ##                  DVD Return Policy



      DVDs are non-refundable but may be exchanged within 30-days of the invoice date                 for a functional version of the same film by using the shipping label packaged with                 your order. If you have any questions or concerns, please [                     contact us](http://www.newegg.com/HelpInfo/CustomerService.aspx) for help.



      Marketplace: Newegg Marketplace sellers may have DVD return policies that differ                  from Newegg's DVD return policy set forth above. Check the Seller's Policy Page for                  the DVD return policies of individual Marketplace sellers. In the event of a conflict                  between Newegg's DVD return policy and those on a Seller's Policy Page, the Seller's                  Policy Page DVD return polices shall apply to your DVD orders from that seller.


      ##         Physical Damage Policy



      Physical damage to any product purchased at         Newegg.com         will effectively void                  warranty coverage. Improper Installation of CPU fans and/or improper clocking may         cause CPUs to chip. CPUs that are chipped, burnt or have bent pins are considered         physically damaged and cannot be returned for refund or replacement. Physical damage         includes but is not limited to improper handling and/or any other type of damage         sustained by irregular usage.         Newegg.com         encounters bent pins regularly when inspecting physically damaged CPUs. Forcing         a processor into position will not solve an installation problem and may consequently         void any applicable warranty coverage. Intel and AMD will not accept physically         damaged processors back from         Newegg.com. As a result,         Newegg.com         will return any physically damaged CPU back to the customer at the customer's expense.


      ##         Restocking Fee



      A 15% restocking fee will be applied to all returns for refund.                  Shipping charges are non-refundable. No refunds after 30 days.



      Marketplace: If you purchase an item from a Newegg Marketplace seller and need to return it,          you must return that item to the Marketplace seller rather than to Newegg, and the return of          that item will be subject to the restocking fee policies of that Marketplace seller rather          than those of Newegg. Check the Seller's Policy Page for the restocking fee policies of          individual Marketplace sellers.


      ##          Technical Support



      Newegg.com         does not offer any sort of technical assistance. We cannot offer advice on compatibility         of items, make product recommendations, provide technical support or sales advice.         We post all of the information the manufacturer provides us with for your convenience.         Please contact the manufacturer directly for accurate answers to your technical         questions or for additional information or specifications that are not posted at         Newegg.com.



      Marketplace: If you purchase an item from a Newegg Marketplace seller and need technical support,          please direct your requests for technical assistance to that seller. However, please be aware          that certain Marketplace sellers may not offer technical assistance. Check the Seller's Policy          Page of individual Marketplace sellers for details.


      ##         Processing Time



      You can expect your order to be processed within approximately 24-48 hours, provided                 the items are in stock and there are no problems with payment verification.                 Newegg.com                 does not guarantee same day-shipping. Orders are not processed on weekends and holidays.



      Marketplace: If you purchase an item from a Newegg Marketplace seller, that seller is responsible          for shipping the item to you. While Newegg does not guarantee processing times for Marketplace          transactions, in general Marketplace sellers should process orders within two business days of          order verification.


      ##                 <a name="rush" class="noLine">Rush processing</a>



      Newegg.com                 will rush process your order for an additional fee provided that the following conditions                 are met:



      * Order is submitted before 12 noon PST.
      * Your transaction and credit card authorization is successfully completed before                     12:30PM PST.
      * Your shipping address matches your credit card billing address (i.e. No alternate                     ship to address).
      * Rush Processing does NOT apply to Pre-Paid Check orders.



      ##                 Rush Processing Disclaimer:



      IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES,                 NEWEGG.COM                 'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THIS RUSH ORDER FEE ONLY. WHILE                 NEWEGG.COM                 CANNOT GUARANTEE SAME DAY SHIPMENT FOR ALL ORDERS,                 NEWEGG.COM                 WILL PUT FORTH ITS BEST EFFORT TO SHIP ALL RUSH PROCESSING ORDERS THE SAME BUSINESS                 DAY IF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS ARE MET. OTHERWISE, YOUR $2.99 RUSH PROCESSING FEE WILL                 BE REFUNDED.



      Marketplace: Rush processing is not currently available for items purchased from Newegg Marketplace sellers.


      ##         Pre-orders



      Click the Pre-order button in the item description and checkout as you normally                 would. A Sales Order number will be issued at the Order Confirmation screen just                 as if you were placing a conventional order, but your credit/debit card will not                 be charged until your pre-ordered DVD or software is in stock and ready to ship.                 If you purchase an in-stock item with a pre-order item, you will be charged accordingly                 for the available product and the difference when your pre-ordered item is in stock                 and ready for shipment. In this instance, two Sales Order numbers will be issued;                 one for the in-stock merchandise and one for the pre-ordered merchandise. You will                 be kept up-to-date via our Web site and through standard Order Status emails to your                 account.



      Marketplace: Pre-ordering is not currently available for items offered for purchase from Newegg Marketplace sellers.


      ##         Backorders



      Newegg.com         does not sell backordered merchandise. We will never purposely charge a customer         for an item that we do not physically have in stock at the time of purchase. Occasional         inventory discrepancies may occur due to inaccurate inventory counts or possibly         because the last few items on our shelves are damaged and/or not in a condition         that we can sell to a customer.                          In that instance,         we will refund your credit/debit card for the item, along with any applicable tax         fees and shipping charges. An automated email will also be sent to your         Newegg.com         login to alert you of the situation.



      Marketplace: Back ordering is not currently available for items offered by Newegg Marketplace sellers.


      ##         Order status



      Newegg.com                 will keep you informed of your order status via e-mail. All tracking information                 will be emailed to your                 Newegg.com                 ID once your order has shipped (except when an APO/FPO is the shipping destination).                 You may also acquire your order status and other live updates by logging in to your                 account on our Web site.


      ##         Security



      Security is our number one priority. All on-line transactions are sent through our         secure server and encrypted with 128-bit technology. Once we receive your information         through the internet, only trusted, authorized employees will process the payment         to make sure your information is handled with the utmost level of security.


      ##         Privacy



      Newegg.com         respects your privacy. We will not under any circumstances sell or release your         information to anyone except as outlined in our privacy policy. All of the information         obtained from our Web site will be used for processing purposes only.                          The only e-mails you will receive from                 Newegg.com                 are         updates to any recent orders and/or returns.


      ##                  Safe Shopping Guarantee



      **Fair Credit Billing Act:** We guarantee that every online transaction
                you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are
                made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit
                Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 for fraudulent
                charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover
                the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability
                if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own
                from purchases made while using our secure server. In the event of unauthorized
                use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance
                with its reporting rules and procedures.


      ##         Change Orders



      You may request a change to your order provided the order has not already been charged         to your account. Please call 1-800-390-1119 during         Newegg.com's hours of operation to request a change to your order. Please have your sales         order (SO) or customer number ready for better assistance. We strongly discourage         sending change order requests via email because it is unlikely we will receive the         message in time to make an adjustment due to the sheer volume of emails we receive         each day.


      ##         Cancel Orders



      You may request that an order be cancelled provided the order has not already been         processed and shipped. Simply call 1-800-390-1119 during         Newegg.com's hours of operation to request an order cancellation. You will receive a credit         for the full amount to your credit/debit card in approximately 1-2 business days.         We strongly discourage sending order cancellation requests via email because it         is unlikely we will receive the message in time to void the order due to the sheer         volume of emails we receive each day.

      ##         Volume Discounts



      Newegg.com         does not have a reseller or discount program available at this time. We work hard         to negotiate the best values on the Internet and offer these tremendous values to         all of our customers via our Web site.

      ##          Product Listings



      Newegg.com         strives for accuracy in all item descriptions, photographs, compatibility references,         detailed specifications, pricing, links and any other product-related information         contained herein or referenced on our Web site. Due to human error and other                          determinates         we cannot guarantee that all item descriptions, photographs, compatibility references,         detailed specifications, pricing, links                          and         any other product-related information listed is entirely accurate, complete or current,         nor can we assume responsibility for these errors. In the event a product listed         on our Web site is labeled with an incorrect price due to some typographical, informational,         technical or other error,         Newegg.com         shall at its sole discretion have the right to refuse and/or cancel any order for         said product and immediately amend, correct and/or remove the inaccurate information.         Additionally, all hyperlinks to other Web sites from         Newegg.com         are provided as resources to customers looking for additional information and/or         professional opinion.         Newegg.com         does not assume responsibility for the claims and/or representations made on these         or any other Web sites.


      ##         Product Revisions



      Newegg.com         is not responsible for changes or variations in product specifications and/or physical         appearance. In the interest of our customers,         Newegg.com         puts forth its best efforts to ensure that all product information is up-to-date         and factual. Unfortunately there are                          varying determinates         which, although infrequent, could cause the information on our Web site to become         outdated without our immediate knowledge.                          This includes but is         not limited to new versions or revisions, color deviations, retail package alterations         and other variations that may be considered inconsequential by the manufacturer.         Newegg.com         relies on the manufacturer to communicate these differences. Presently we have no         way of alerting customers prior to purchase in the event the manufacturer fails         to                          do so.         Consequently,         Newegg.com         will not be held responsible for product revision changes.

      ##          Product Return Procedure



      * To return a product in compliance with                     Newegg.com's satisfaction guarantee, you must obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization ("RMA")                     number within the guarantee return period for the product (described above). Please                     [click here](https://secure.newegg.com/RMA/Returns.aspx) to acquire
                    an RMA number. All RMA requests must be filed online.
                    Newegg.com
                    will not accept returns without prior authorization and a RMA number. Once issued,
                    RMA numbers are valid for 15 days within which return products must be received
                    by
                    Newegg.com. RMA numbers will not be extended or reissued. Customer should prominently display
                    the RMA number(s) on the shipping label of boxes containing the returned product.
      * Customer is solely responsible for shipping any returned product to                     Newegg.com. Customer agrees to use only reputable carriers capable of providing proof of delivery                     and insurance for the entire value of the shipment. Customer agrees to bear all                     shipping and insurance charges and all risk of loss for the return product during                     shipment. Customer agrees that all returned products will be 100% complete, in re-saleable                     condition, and will include the original packaging material, manuals, blank warranty                     cards, and other accessories provided by the manufacturer. If any component of the                     returned product is missing,                     Newegg.com's Return Procedure will be breached and                     Newegg.com                     may in its sole and absolute discretion reject the entire return or choose to impose                     additional charges against the customer for replacement of the missing component(s).
      * Newegg.com                     will not refund to Customer the original shipping charges. In addition,                     Newegg.com                     will assess a 15% restocking fee against the Customer's account on all returns for                     refund.
      * Marketplace: If you purchase an item from a Newegg Marketplace seller and need to return it,                      you must return that item to the Marketplace seller rather than to Newegg. Check the Seller's                      Policy Page for the return procedure of individual Marketplace sellers. In the event of a                      conflict between Newegg's product return procedure and those on a Seller's Policy Page,                      the Seller's Policy Page return procedures shall apply to your orders from that seller.

Newegg.com Return Guidelines



      All returns require an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number, 	        which can be obtained by contacting our [Customer 	        Service](http://www.newegg.com/HelpInfo/CustomerService.aspx) department or clicking the "[My 	        Account](https://secure.newegg.com/NewMyAccount/Index.aspx)" button in the top-right hand corner of our web
	        page.

      Please save all packaging and 	        accessories for any item that is returned to Newegg.com. All original equipment, components, manuals, cables, documents and packaging must be returned with your item in order for 	        Newegg.com to process your RMA.Â  An item returned for a replacement may 	        be repaired or replaced at Newegg.com's discretion, unless otherwise 	        required by law.Â  Products with specific refund and return policies 	        and deadlines must be returned within the time periods specified for 	        each item.Â  All items sold through Newegg.com are subject to our [Policy 	        and Agreement](http://www.newegg.com/HelpInfo/PolicyAgreement.aspx).Â  Physically damaged items cannot be returned.

      <a name="14"></a>

  

      General Policy

      These are Newegg.comâs (âNeweggâ, âweâ or âourâ) Standard Return Policies applicable only to products purchased by you directly from the Newegg.com website.

      * All product returns require a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.Â  You may obtain an RMA number by contacting Newegg Customer Service through any of the methods provided at [www.newegg.com/HelpInfo/CustomerService.aspx](http://www.newegg.com/HelpInfo/CustomerService.aspx).
      * Any return for a refund may be subject to a 15% restocking fee.
      * Products that are not eligible for return and will be sent back to you at your cost and expense if received by us:


          * Any product not purchased from Newegg.com
          * Any product without a valid, readable serial number, including but not limited to products with missing, damaged, altered, or otherwise unreadable serial number
          * Any product that is returned without all original packaging and accessories, including the retail box, manuals, cables, and all other items originally included with the product
          * Any product from which the UPC code has been removed from its packaging
          * Any product that exhibits physical damage
          * Any product for which you have submitted a mail-in rebate






      Mail-In Rebate Policy

      Any product offering a mail-in rebate is not returnable to Newegg once the rebate has been filed. Be sure that the product is functional and that you intend to keep the product before sending in for your rebate. Products missing UPC codes or serial numbers from the box are NOT returnable. Only the product manufacturer can replace a defective item missing the UPC code.



<a name="combo">Combo, Bundle and Kit Specials</a>

      Combo, Bundle, and Kit Specials include two or more items that must be purchased together in order to receive a discount.



      Items sold as part of a Combo, Bundle or Kit may be returned individually for replacement within the applicable Newegg.com Return Policy Period for that individual item.



      If an individual Combo, Bundle or Kit item is returned for a refund, the applicable discount will be voided, and the discounted amount will be deducted from the amount of the refund. If your combo/bundle/kit discount amount is greater than the individual unit price of the item you wish to return, then the item cannot be returned for a refund; you will need to return all items in the combo/bundle/kit in order to receive a refund.

      - *For example*: if your combo/bundle/kit discount was $5, and you return one of the items for a refund, the $5 will be deducted from your RMA refund amount.



<a name="promotional">Manufacturer Promotional Items and Newegg Gifts</a>

      Manufacturers may offer free promotional items with their products. For example, a video card may come with a free game or a Blu-ray player may come with a free Blu-ray disc. To receive a full refund on a purchase that offers promotional items all items must be returned. The cost of any promotional items not returned will be deducted from the refund total.



      Newegg may also offer gifts to valued customers for their continued support as well as for special giveaways. These gifts are not part of any purchase value and therefore do not have to be returned.



Out-of-Stock (Back-Order) Items

      If Newegg no longer carries an item that is sent in for replacement, or if that item is simply out of stock, the item will be sent to our Back-Order RMA Department. You will be notified via email of two options: 1) Newegg can send you a comparable replacement item, or 2) Newegg can issue you a refund at the current market value of the product. A current-market-value refund may not exceed the original invoice price. If the item is returned within 30 days of the original invoice date, a full refund will be issued.



Quantity Purchases

      While Newegg is more than happy to fill your order for a quantity of ten (10) or more of any given item in our inventory on a single purchase order, please understand that an order of that size, once purchase is completed, is automatically non-refundable. All other specific conditions related to the ordered item still apply, including any and all stipulations relative to any available replacement return policies. Please contact Customer Service with any questions you may have.
