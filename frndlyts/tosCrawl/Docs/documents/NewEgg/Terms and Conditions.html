                Electronic Waste Recycling Act</h2>
            <p>
                The Electronic Waste Recycling Act ("Act") became law in California on
                January 1, 2005. The primary objective of this law is to initiate a recycling program
                for computer products containing chemicals deemed hazardous to the environment.
                To fund this program, California requires retailers and e-tailers to collect, on
                the state's behalf, a fee for each product covered by this law. The fee is paid
                by the consumer at the time of purchase of the covered product. This fee will be
                remitted directly to the state by and only applies to orders shipped within California.
            </p>
            <p>

                The types of products that we are required to collect this recycling fee include
                cathode ray tubes, cathode ray tube devices, flat panel screens, and other similar
                video display devices. The actual amount of the recycling fee will vary, based on
                the screen size of the product when measured diagonally, as follows:
            </p>
            <ul><li>Greater than 4" and less than 15" -- $6.00</li>
                <li>Greater than or equal to 15" and less than 35" -- $8.00</li>

                <li>Greater than or equal to 35" -- $10.00</li>
            </ul><p>
                For more information concerning the scope and details of the Act, please refer to
                the California Integrated Waste Management Board's website at <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Electronics/Act2003" target="_blank">http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Electronics/Act2003</a> or to the Department

        "Must Be Purchased with Hardware"</h2>
    <p>
        
                The "must be purchased with hardware" precept is mandated by the software
                publisher. In accordance,
                Newegg.com
                customers must purchase some type of product which falls under the general category
                of computer hardware in order to purchase applicable software. Hardware is classified
                as any component that will be used when assembling a computer system (a hard drive,
                motherboard, processor and a floppy drive are all examples of merchandise that will
                qualify). There is no specific or set price the hardware has to be, merely that
                there is some sort of eligible hardware present in the order itself.

        Physical Damage Policy</h2>

        Physical damage to any product purchased at
        Newegg.com
        will effectively void
        
        warranty coverage. Improper Installation of CPU fans and/or improper clocking may
        cause CPUs to chip. CPUs that are chipped, burnt or have bent pins are considered
        physically damaged and cannot be returned for refund or replacement. Physical damage
        includes but is not limited to improper handling and/or any other type of damage
        sustained by irregular usage.
        Newegg.com
        encounters bent pins regularly when inspecting physically damaged CPUs. Forcing
        a processor into position will not solve an installation problem and may consequently
        void any applicable warranty coverage. Intel and AMD will not accept physically
        damaged processors back from
        Newegg.com. As a result,
        Newegg.com
        will return any physically damaged CPU back to the customer at the customer's expense.

                varying determinates
        which, although infrequent, could cause the information on our Web site to become

        and other variations that may be considered inconsequential by the manufacturer.
        Newegg.com
        relies on the manufacturer to communicate these differences. Presently we have no

                    number within the guarantee return period for the product (described above). Please
                    <a href="https://secure.newegg.com/RMA/Returns.aspx">click here</a> to acquire
                    an RMA number. All RMA requests must be filed online.
                    Newegg.com
                    will not accept returns without prior authorization and a RMA number. Once issued,
                    RMA numbers are valid for 15 days within which return products must be received
                    by
                    Newegg.com. RMA numbers will not be extended or reissued. Customer should prominently display
                    the RMA number(s) on the shipping label of boxes containing the returned product.</li>
                <li>Customer is solely responsible for shipping any returned product to
                    Newegg.com. Customer agrees to use only reputable carriers capable of providing proof of delivery
                    and insurance for the entire value of the shipment. Customer agrees to bear all
                    shipping and insurance charges and all risk of loss for the return product during
                    shipment. Customer agrees that all returned products will be 100% complete, in re-saleable
                    condition, and will include the original packaging material, manuals, blank warranty
                    cards, and other accessories provided by the manufacturer. If any component of the
                    returned product is missing,

        Newegg.com
                will arrange for shipment of ordered product(s) to the Customer, Free On Board (F.O.B.)
                shipping point, meaning title to the product(s) -- excepting software-- and risk
                of loss passes to the Customer upon delivery to the carrier.
                Newegg.com

                Newegg.com
                to protect its purchase money security interest. Title to software will remain with
                the licensor(s). All software is provided subject to the license agreement of the
                software maker. Customer agrees to be bound by any software license agreement once
                the seal on the package is broken.
                Newegg.com
                will advise Customer of estimated shipping dates, but
                Newegg.com
                will, under no circumstances, be responsible for delays in delivery, and associated
                damages, due to events beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation,
                acts of God or public enemy, acts of federal, state or local government, fire, floods,

                transaction between
                Newegg.com
                and Customer shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard
                to its conflicts of law rules. Specifically, the validity, interpretation, and performance
                of this agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the
                International Sale of Goods.
                Newegg.com
                and Customer consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and the exclusive venue of the
                State Courts of the State of California, Los Angeles County, to resolve any dispute
                between them related hereto, and the parities waive all rights to contest this exclusive
                jurisdiction and venue of such Courts. Finally, the Customer also agrees not to bring
                any legal action, based upon any legal theory including contract, tort, equity or

        Severability</h2>

                If any provision contained in this agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal, or
                unenforceable in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability
                shall not affect the remaining provisions and portions of this agreement, and the
                invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified so as to have

                such performance at any time thereafter. Any waiver by either party of a breach
                of any provision in this agreement shall not be taken or held by the other party
                to be a continuing waiver of that provision unless such waiver is made in writing.
