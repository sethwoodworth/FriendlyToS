<br><b>Updated: 04/05/2007</b><br><br>
For over 75 years, The Walt Disney Company has taken great pride in the relationships that it has developed with its guests. In keeping with this tradition, we at the Walt Disney Internet Group are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Kids' Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles with respect to children under the age of 13.
<br><br>
Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which this Kids' Privacy Policy is posted. We explain those additional protections here in this Kids' Privacy Policy. For your convenience, this Kids' Privacy Policy uses terms that are defined in our general Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web sites. Below we explain how we do that for these "kids." Also, when we use the term "parent" below, we mean to include legal guardians.

										<td class="copy">Kids can surf Disney.com and other WDIG sites, view content, and play many games without any personal information being collected. We do not collect personal information from kids unless they register on WDIG sites. Typically, kids will register in order to participate in sweepstakes or contests or to participate in a special activity. The only information we collect from kids during our registration process is a kid's first name, parent's e-mail address, kid's birth date, member name, and password. We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including kids. We do not collect any other personally identifiable information from kids during our registration process. We also will collect a kid's e-mail address from a parent for the purpose of sending the kid e-mail related to a subscription. For example, we would send Disney Game Kingdom Online Post to a kid directly at the request of the kid's parent. Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary. 
<br><br>
We may collect personal information from parents in order to allow kids to participate in certain features located on our Web sites and within our kids' subscription products, such as True Friends on Disney Xtreme Digital (SM), Disney's Blast and Disney's Toontown Online (see A3 below for details). These features may include one to one instant message chatting (for example, Secret Friends in Disney's Toontown Online), sending e-mail, posting on message boards, and other similar activities. In the course of a kid's participation in these features, a kid may also provide us additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her chat or message board postings. If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their kid, we may link certain information collected through technology (see the "Information Collected Through Technology" section of A2 of our general Privacy Policy) to that personal information.

										<td class="copy">If a kid registers for a sweepstakes or contest, we use the parent's e-mail address to notify the parent of the kid's registration request (as described in detail below in A3). To personalize communications to a kid regarding a specific product (such as Disney's Blast), we may use the kid's first name combined with the parent's last name and a mailing address provided by the parent when signing up for that specific product. We may collect a kid's e-mail address from the parent in order to send the kid a newsletter, such as Disney Game Kingdom Online Post. In addition, personal information regarding a kid may be collected and used to enable a kid's participation in certain interactive features such as instant message chatting, sending e-mail, posting on message boards and other similar activities. These activities may involve disclosure of a kid's personal information to third parties.  In addition, we may share a kid's personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to:  protect the security of integrity of our sites; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.

										<td class="copy">We send parents an e-mail when their kid registers and enters a sweepstakes or contest and we provide parents 48 hours to refuse their kid's registration and entry in the sweepstakes or contest. If the parent refuses to allow the kid's registration and entry, we delete the kid's information from our database. If we don't hear back from the parent, we assume it is acceptable for the kid to be registered and entered in the sweepstakes or contest. Once a parent permits a kid to register, the kid will be able to enter future registration-based sweepstakes or contests without any further notification to the parent. If a kid wins a sweepstakes or contest, we notify the parent at the parent's e-mail address provided to us during the registration process and request that the parent provide their postal address for purposes of delivering the prize. We may publish a winner's first name, first initial of last name, city, and state of residence on our Web sites. 
<br><br>
We collect personal information from kids when they participate in activities such as one to one instant message chatting in True Friends on Disney Xtreme Digital (SM).   Before allowing a kid to use these features, we send an e-mail to the kid's parent requesting the parent's affirmative consent to the kid's participation.  If the parent responds by e-mail and gives such consent, we then follow that communication with an e-mail confirmation to the parent and allow the kid to particiapte in the activity.
<br><br>
Before allowing a kid to use a feature of our Web sites that might result in the public disclosure of the kid's information to third parties on the Internet, such as posting on open message boards, we require a high level of verification to confirm that the parent has given permission for the kid's participation in such features.  For example, we may require a parent to provide us credit card information, speak to a trained telephone operator or return by postal mail or fax a signed consent form.

The parent will need to have their kid's member name and password. There are instructions on the Your Account home page explaining how to recover a password if the kid has forgotten it.
</li><li>A parent can contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete the personal information that we have collected from his or her kid by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ms_support@help.go.com" name="lid=corp_kids/contentlink/link11/100210">ms_support@help.go.com</a>.
