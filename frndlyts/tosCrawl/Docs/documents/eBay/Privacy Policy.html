                <p style="margin-top:0px;">This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on the eBay websites, tools, applications, and services. It applies generally to the eBay.com website and content and other related websites where this policy appears in the footer of the page. Some eBay-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website.</p>
                <p style="">By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on June 1, 2011. </p>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc. has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators. These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc. to adequately protect your personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location, may provide additional privacy rights through your privacy regulator or a court. If you would like additional information regarding the Corporate Rules contact us via the contact details below.</p><a name="Collection"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Collection </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">You can browse our sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">We may collect and store the following personal information:</p>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising.

                <h4 class="paraHeader">Registration and sharing through third-party services.</h4>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">We may offer single sign-on services that allow you to use third party login credentials to sign into eBay. With your permission, eBay may also transfer to eBay profile information contained in your third-party profile. eBay may also, for your use, enable you to import information about who you are connected to, as well as enable you to share information with those third-party sites. If you wish to discontinue such sharing, you will be able to do so through your preference page.</p><a name="Disclosure"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Our Disclosure of Your Information </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">We may also share your personal information with:</p>

Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you’ve requested their services. </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards). </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay user to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">eBay VeRO Program participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

(Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)</p></div></li></ul><p style="">Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p><a name="Activity"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Information You Share on eBay</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Your User ID is displayed throughout eBay (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your eBay activity. Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities. </p>
                <p style="">If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, certain information about you, such as your User ID, activity or reminders from eBay, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p><a name="Using"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Using Information from eBay </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">eBay enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. When users are involved in a transaction, they <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/contacting-members.html#contact">may have access</a> to each other's name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">You agree to use user information only for:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 6px;"><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">eBay transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages; </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, and fraud complaints), or</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">other purposes that a user expressly chooses.</p></div></li></ul><a name="cookies"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Cookies </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. For more information about why we use cookies, see <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/cookies-web-beacons.html">Cookies, Web Beacons, and Your </a>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">A few important things you should know about cookies are that: </p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 6px;"><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies. </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services. </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)</p></div></li></ul><a name="Spam"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your eBay communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other eBay users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails to eBay, please forward the email to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a> or <a href="mailto:spoof@ebay.com">spoof@ebay.com</a>. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. </p><a name="Protection"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Account Protection </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your eBay password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify eBay and change your password. </p><a name="Accessing"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to eBay. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html" target="_blank">eBay User Agreement</a>, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p><a name="Security"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Security </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. </p><a name="Third"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Third Parties</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. eBay does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. </p><a name="General"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">General </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the site. In addition, we will notify you through the eBay Message Center. If your questions are not answered online, you may write to us at: eBay Inc.
