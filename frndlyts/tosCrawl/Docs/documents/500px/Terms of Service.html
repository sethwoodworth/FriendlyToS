				provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in
				full force and effect and enforceable. 500px may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms and its rights and obligations
				without consent. The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ontario, as if made
				within Ontario between two residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of Ontario courts.
				Both parties agree that the Terms is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the
				parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other
				understandings relating to the subject matter of the Terms, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by
				both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.</p>
